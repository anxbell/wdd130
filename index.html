            <p>Hello. My name is Valerie Sanchez, I am twenty-one years old, I was born in Los Angeles, California but I have lived almost all my life in El Salvador, I moved back to the US at the age of nineteen. I started college in El Salvador in the Faculty of Medicine but I decided to move to the US, then I started College in the US, I was majoring in Biology (Biomedical Sciences), because I wanted to attend Medical School, then I transfered universities and now I am currently majoring in Software development. I like reading and playing with my dogs. I love my family, my friends and I enjoy volunteering when I have the opportunity. I also enjoy playing videogames, my favorite genre is adventure but I also like playing competitive in many other games.</p>
